# Data Science Project
## Getting and Cleaning Data Course

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Sample Dataset:
Source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
This is a collection of data from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone
Combining and merging data from 5 raw text files has resulted into a data frame with a dimension of 10299 observation of 562 variables

Result:
After cleaning and reshaping the raw data (tidydata.txt)
The data frame dimension is now 66 observations of 7 variables (using the mean function).

CodeBook.md will describe how I cleaned & reshaped the raw data and the variables involved.
